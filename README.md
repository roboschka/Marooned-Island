# Marooned-Island :mountain:
## :one: Description
This game tells a story about the player being abandoned (more like stranded) on an island, filled with Cannibals and Boars. The game's core mechanic is that there's wave. Each waves have their own number of enemies, the higher the wave, the harder. Players must survive the game, and reach the highest level/wave they can get. 

A little credit: Thanks to Freecodecamp for the free 3D assets :v: , they also made a game using these free assets, I saw it, I took it and gave them credits, so no problem. :smiley:

## :two: Progress
This game is a final project for our AI and Game Engine Programming courses. We needed to implement AI (the enemies) behaviours into the game whilst also exploring many functionality of Unity Engine. Although we did this in the span of a month, we managed to:
* Added the final music and SFX into the game
* Finished the UI
* Finished implementing the Core Mechanic
* Finished implementing the AI
* Finished importing and instatiate 3D Characters
* Finished implementing Character's weapons + their physics
